        <p>Long ago...well not so long ago...on a farm in Missouri, a little puppy entered the world with a litter of brothers and sisters. <br> 
            As the runt, he knew he'd have to work hard to get the love and attention he wanted. <br> 
            He did his best to grow big and strong, and after days on the farm, he got in a car and headed to Indiana.</p>
        <h2>Indiana Or Bust</h2>

        <p>Dropped in an unfamiliar envinronment, the little puppy was all alone.<br> 
            Not totally alone, there were other puppies through metal grates, but he was alone. <br> 
            Every day, a sad girl came and held him to her chest. She played with him and made him feel wanted. <br> 
            Day after day, she kept her promise to come back and make sure he had the love he deserved. <br> 
            But each day, she left. As the puppy grew, he no longer fit in the metal box he was originally confined to. <br> 
            He began to wander from door to door, waiting for the girl to come back once again. </p>
        <h2>It's This, Or Death</h2>

        <p>Little did the puppy know that the girl thought of him often. <br> 
            She looked forward to seeing him everyday and his happy, wagging nubbin is what kept her going. <br> 
            See, she was kept in a metal caged box too. She never felt happy, unless she was with the little puppy, and knew that he was the secret to combating the evil monster of depression. <br> 
            One day the owner of the metal cages told the girl, "You have to take that puppy home. <br> 
            He's no longer a puppy and if he stays any longer, he will be sent to a kill shelter where he will die alone." <br> 
            The girl knew she couldn't take him home...but she did any way.</p>
        <h2>And Then, There Were Two</h2>

        <p>From then on, the puppy and girl were inseperable. <br> 
            She was his whole life and he was her's. <br> 
            As the years dragged on then flew by, the puppy grew big and strong. <br> 
            He no longer wondered if the girl would come back for him but knew everyday, she would come home to give him the love he always deserved.</p>
