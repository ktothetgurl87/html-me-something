        <p>Long ago...well not so long ago...on a farm in Missouri, a little puppy entered the world with a litter of brothers and sisters. As the runt, he knew he'd have to work hard to get the love and attention he wanted. He did his best to grow big and strong, and after days on the farm, he got in a car and headed to Indiana.</p>
        <h2>Indiana Or Bust</h2>
        <p>Dropped in an unfamiliar envinronment, the little puppy was all alone. Not totally alone, there were other puppies through metal grates, but he was alone. Every day, a sad girl came and held him to her chest. She played with him and made him feel wanted. Day after day, she kept her promise to come back and make sure he had the love he deserved. But each day, she left. As the puppy grew, he no longer fit in the metal box he was originally confined to. He began to wander from door to door, waiting for the girl to come back once again. </p>
        <h2>It's This, Or Death</h2>
        <p>Little did the puppy know that the girl thought of him often. She looked forward to seeing him everyday and his happy, wagging nubbin is what kept her going. See, she was kept in a metal caged box too. She never felt happy, unless she was with the little puppy, and knew that he was the secret to combating the evil monster of depression. One day the owner of the metal cages told the girl, "You have to take that puppy home. He's no longer a puppy and if he stays any longer, he will be sent to a kill shelter where he will die alone." The girl knew she couldn't take him home...but she did any way.</p>
        <h2>And Then, There Were Two</h2>
        <p>From then on, the puppy and girl were inseperable. She was his whole life and he was her's. As the years dragged on then flew by, the puppy grew big and strong. He no longer wondered if the girl would come back for him but knew everyday, she would come home to give him the love he always deserved.</p>
